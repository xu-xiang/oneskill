## 💡 Why OneSkill?

Your AI Agent is strong, but it can be even stronger.

**OneSkill** is the bridge connecting your Agent to the massive [OpenSkills](https://github.com/Starttoaster/openskills) ecosystem (which can be complex to navigate and install manually). By installing just this one tool, your Agent gains the ability to evolve itself: **discover new skills, install them more easily, and support a wide range of tools like Codex, Gemini, and more.**

No more manual file downloads or configuration edits. Everything is automated.

## 🚀 Core Value

*   **Massive Skill Library**: Instantly connect to thousands of community-maintained Skills (Web browsing, Database management, Code auditing, Cloud infrastructure ops, etc.).
*   **One-Click Installation**: A single command handles downloading, dependency resolution, and environment configuration.
*   **Perfect Gemini Adaptation**: Developed the `map` feature for Gemini CLI, automatically injecting Skills downloaded via OpenSkills into Gemini's path.

## ⚡️ Quick Experience

### Step 1: Install OneSkill (Once only)

```bash
# Install the core tool
npx openskills install xu-xiang/oneskill --global

# (Only required for Gemini users) Map OneSkill itself to .gemini
npx oneskill map --target gemini --global
```

### Step 2: Unlock Infinite Possibilities

Once installed, simply ask your Agent (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini-cli, etc.) to find and recommend suitable skills or use natural language to have it check for a skill to solve the problem at hand. OneSkill will handle the rest.

#### Scenario Demo: Autonomous Evolution in Chat

You don't even need to leave the chat window. Just tell your Agent what you need, and let OneSkill do the heavy lifting.

The following real chat record shows how an Agent instantly gains **FastAPI development capabilities** via OneSkill:

✦ Installation complete! I have learned `fastapi-templates`.
  Now you can ask me: "How do I use this template to create a new project with async mode?"
```

**💥 Result**: The Agent automatically completed the search, download, filtering, and environment configuration without you having to type a single command.

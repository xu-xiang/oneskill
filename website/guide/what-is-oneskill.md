# What is OneSkill?

Your AI Agent is strong, but it can be limitless.

**OneSkill** is the bridge connecting your Agent to the massive [OpenSkills](https://github.com/Starttoaster/openskills) ecosystem. By installing just this one tool, your Agent gains the ability to evolve itself: **discover new skills, install them more easily, and support a wide range of tools like Codex, Gemini, and more.**

No more manual file downloads or configuration edits. Everything is automated.

## Core Value

*   **Massive Skill Library**: Instantly connect to thousands of community-maintained Skills (Web browsing, Database management, Code auditing, Cloud infrastructure ops, etc.).
*   **One-Click Installation**: A single command handles downloading, dependency resolution, and environment configuration.
*   **Perfect Gemini Adaptation**: Developed the `map` feature for Gemini CLI, automatically injecting Skills downloaded via OpenSkills into Gemini's path.
